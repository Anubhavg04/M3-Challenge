## M3 Challenge (Memory Game🧠)
A simple broswer-based game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The game is easy to play but as you level up it is not easy to play😂 because you have to memorise the patterns, and does not require any login or setup.

## How to Play⬇️
- Open the game in your broswer
- Choose your difficulty level and start with show pattern button
- Enjoy the game and sharp you mind memory!
